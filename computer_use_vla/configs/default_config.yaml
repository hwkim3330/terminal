# Computer Use VLA - Default Configuration
# Inspired by NVIDIA Alpamayo configuration

# Model Configuration
model:
  # VLM backbone options:
  # - "LiquidAI/LFM2.5-VL-1.6B" (lightweight, edge-friendly)
  # - "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct" (more powerful)
  name: "LiquidAI/LFM2.5-VL-1.6B"
  dtype: "float16"  # float16, bfloat16, float32
  device: "cuda"    # cuda, cpu

  # Attention implementation
  # - "flash_attention_2" (fastest, requires flash-attn)
  # - "sdpa" (PyTorch native)
  # - "eager" (standard)
  attn_implementation: "sdpa"

  # Action space configuration
  action_space:
    type: "continuous"  # continuous, discrete
    grid_size: 100      # For discrete action space

# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
reasoning:
  enabled: true
  max_tokens: 512

  # Reasoning steps (inspired by Alpamayo's Chain-of-Causation)
  steps:
    - screen_analysis    # What is on the screen?
    - task_understanding # What needs to be done?
    - ui_identification  # Where are relevant elements?
    - action_planning    # What action should be taken?
    - safety_check       # Is this action safe?

  # Safety
  safe_mode: true           # Block dangerous actions
  dry_run: false            # Don't execute actions (for testing)

# Agent Configuration
